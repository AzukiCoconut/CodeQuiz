## Description
This is a fun little game that tests a player's knowledge of JavaScript.  It is a short quiz where the user has 60 seconds to answer 5 questions. 
If the user answers any question wrong, they will lose 10 seconds from their time.  The time at which the user answered the final question is the 
score the user obtained.  The user will have the opportunity to add their score to the high score list with their initials.  Hope you enjoy playing

## Credits
I learned quite a bit with this project.  The following sites assisted me with creation of this project.

  1. UNB Coding Bootcamp challenge 4 gave the inspiration for the design of the site.
  2. Asif Mughal's article on JavaScript Multiple Choice Quiz Questions Code https://www.codehim.com/vanilla-javascript/javascript-multiple-choice-questions-code/
     gave me the start on how to plan out and setup the project.  This was the inspiration for algorithm for managing the question and answer display for this project.
  3. andyshah's article on Store multiple objects with same name in local storage in store.js was particularly helpful for the High Score listing.
